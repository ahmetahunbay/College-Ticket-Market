# College-Ticket-Market
Efficient ticket market for student section games. This program allows for students to put in buy/sell orders for student section tickets, with specific prices and expiration dates. Listed tickets have a bid price and a buy now price, while listed orders have a sell now price. 

Tickets are stored in a heap that displays the cheapest buy now price. Orders are stored in a heap that displays the highest value order. Tickets are also stored in an alt-list. This alt list displays tickets with relevant bid-prices and expiration dates in a modified tree.
